## 📖 Project Overview  

Buying or selling property is one of the most important financial decisions for individuals and businesses. However, predicting the correct value of a property can be challenging due to multiple factors such as **location, amenities, demand, and size**.  

This project solves that problem by providing an **AI-powered price prediction system**:  
- 🖥️ Users can **input house details** via a simple web interface.  
- 🤖 The ML model processes these details and outputs an **estimated market value**.  
- 📊 The app also provides **visual insights** about the dataset and model performance.  

The project is ideal for demonstrating **machine learning in real-world use cases**, while also showcasing **Streamlit deployment skills** for portfolio/placement purposes.
